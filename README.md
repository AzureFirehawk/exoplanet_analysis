# exoplanet_analysis
# Overview


This program analyzes NASA's Exoplanet Archive (link below). The dataset outlines atributes of each planet discovered and their star system, including the planet discovery method, measured mass and radius, distance from earth, and other measurements. 

Exoplanets have always been fascinating to me, and I enjoy learning more about them. Additionally, building software for data analysis is a skillset I have been wanting to work on developing. This program helps to combine those two passions: an opportunity to learn how to utilize Pandas and NumPy, as well as learning more about exoplanets.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

Q. What is the most common discover method?
A. Transit observation

Q. Is it more common to find closer or more distant planets?
A. Most of the exoplanets we've discovered are relatively close.

Q. How large are the planets we're discovering?
A. Most exoplanets discovered have been between 2 and 6 times the radius of the Earth

Q. How has our certainty in measurements changed over time?
A. Uncertainty in exoplanet radius measurements has decreased in, while uncertainty in distance measurements has increased.

# Development Environment

This program was written in VSCode.

This software is written in Python, and primarily uses the Pandas library for analysis and data cleaning. It also uses NumPy and matplotlib to perform some aggregation and visualization of data.

# Future Work

* Find a way to display all visualizations at once.
* Set up a cleaner output for the data for ease of reading.
* User interactivity in selecting which area of the data to process and display
