# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This program analyzes NASA's Exoplanet Archive (link below). The dataset outlines atributes of each planet discovered and their star system, including the planet discovery method, measured mass and radius, distance from earth, and other measurements. 

Exoplanets have always been fascinating to me, and I enjoy learning more about them. Additionally, building software for data analysis is a skillset I have been wanting to work on developing. This program helps to combine those two passions: an opportunity to learn how to utilize Pandas and NumPy, as well as learning more about exoplanets.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

1. What is the most common discover method?
2. Is it more common to find closer or more distant planets?
3. How large are the planets we're discovering?
4. How has our certainty in measurements changed over time?
